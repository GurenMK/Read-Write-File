# Read-Write-File

The program reads a text file "in.txt", converts all letters to uppercase,
and writes all contents of the read file to "out.txt"
reads and writes multiple lines
"out.txt" will be created if it doesn't exist,
otherwise all its contents will be erased and re-written
numbers and special characters are unaffected
